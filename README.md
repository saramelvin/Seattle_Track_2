## Welcome to HACKtheMACHINE 2018!

This GitHub repository contains instructions, examples, data, and software utilities to help you in Track 2: Data Science and the Seven Seas.  If you are not familiar with `git` version control follow these instruction on any mac, or linux machine.  On Windows it is very similar after you install the git client. Note: `user$` indicates the terminal prompt, not something you should type.

### Installation

1. Contestants will create a **Fork of the base repo** and develop their solutions over the course of HACKtheMACHINE.  When you are ready to submit your answers **create a pull request to the master branch** of this repo.

2. Set up by logging into your github account (create one [here](https://github.com/join) if you need to).  Once logged in, click the fork button in the top right corner of the repo homepage.

3. Forking the repo will create a copy of the repo in your own account, but the files are still in the cloud and you need to get them onto your own machine.
4. So clone your fork onto your local machine.  Open a command line terminal window and enter this command:

  `user$ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/Seattle_Track_2.git`
5. This will create a folder on your local machine called `/Seattle_Track_2`.  Consider starting by `user$ cd Seattle_Track_2/Data` and then running `user$ ./get_data.sh` or `python get_data.py` to download your own copy of the base datasets.

### Getting Started

To get started read over the material in the `/Challenge_Prompts` folder.  Then start poking around.  Each folder has a `README` file to explain what is in it.  For example, take a look at some of the sample data in the `/Data` folder.  The provided data can be manipulated with tools in the `/Utilities` folder.  And finally, create your solution in the `/Submissions` folder and submit it as described in the section below.  **Good Luck!!  Now go Win!**

### Submitting your Solution

1. All of the changes you make on your cloned fork are local to your laptop.  You will need to push your local changes to your cloud GitHub account to submit it for evaluation. Please ask a mentor or a teammate if you need help.  Also, `user$ git help` is pretty good, but issuing these commands, assuming you are working from your `master` branch, inside the `/Seattle_Track_2` folder will work in most use cases.
    ```bash
    user$ git add --all
    user$ git commit -m "Commit my Track2 solution"
    user$ git push
    ```
2. The step above pushes your code to your own GitHub account, and this is a great way to share ideas among your own team, but you will [**create a pull reqeust**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) to the [**master branch of this repo**](https://github.com/FATHOM5/Seattle_Track_2) to complete your submission.
